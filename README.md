YOWL is a web application that will allow users to comment on all of the content found on the
Internet. Each comment will be shared by the entire YOWL user community.
Our tool will make it possible to decentralize comments from social networks and to have a new
vision of the web through participatory on sources (OSINT) or simply by adding a comment thus
federating communities around websites.
YOWL is free, YOWL is accessible from the age of 13, YOWL wants to conquer the target 13 35
years old.
We are going to develop the uses but also the application technically and its interface. You,
students of Epitech, will have to present us, in few weeks, an interactive interface by explaining
us each element created.
